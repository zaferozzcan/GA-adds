// An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value

// When to use objects
//-When you do not need order
//- When you need fast access/insertion and removal

// big o of objects operations
// insertion O(1)
// Removal O(1)
// Searchning O(1)
// Access O(1)

// Seems like you dont need any ordering, objects are an excellext choice.
