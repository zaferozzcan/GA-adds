    WHATS IS AN ALGORITHMS
    A process and set of steps to accomplish a certain task!
    
    HOW TO IMPROVE PROBLEM SOLVING SKILL
    1) Devise a plan for solving problem
    2) Master common problem solving problems

    STEPS WHEN PROBLEM SOLVING
    -- Understand the problem
    -- Explore concrate examples
    -- Break It Down
    -- Solve/Simplify
    -- Look back and refactor

    QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BEFORE STARTING TO SOLVE PROBMEN

    1) Can I restate the propblem in my own words?
    2) What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    3) What are the outputs that should come from the solutions to the problem?
    4) Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
    5) How should I lebel the importanat pieces of data that are a part of teh problem?

    // apply these questions a problem "write a function that takes two number an returns sum of them!"
        1) Can I restate the propblem in my own words?
           "implement addition"
        2) What are the inputs that go into the problem?
            -- int? float? 
        3) What are the outputs that should come from the solutions to the problem?
            -- int? float? string?
        4) Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
        5) How should I lebel the importanat pieces of data that are a part of teh problem?
