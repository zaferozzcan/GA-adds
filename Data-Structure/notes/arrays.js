//Big selling point of arrays is that they are ordered--UNLIKE OBJECTS
// so thet can come with a const.

// when you need an order, arrays are the data types. By sasying order, arrays are using indexing this makes it ordered.

// Big O of Arrays

// Searching O(n)
//-----------
// Access O(n)
//-----------
// Inserting --Big O of inserting an item at the end of the array is O(1) it is simple and not very complex. However, the problems arises from when inserting an item at the beginning of the array. This is because when you insert it at the beggging of the array, you are changing every index of elements-- you have to reindex everything!
//-----------
// Likewise, Removing has the same logic-- removing the last item is O(1). However the removing other items is problematic. SO, Push and Pop is always faster than shift and unshift
