## Getting Started

1. We provide you with starter code in the `shape_clicker` folder that has some shapes hardcoded into the html, and some classes in the css file. You don't need to adjust these files, just work primarily in the `app.js` file.

## Shape Clicker 

In `app.js`, write code to perform the following: 

_The page starts out like this_

First, clicking on any shape turns the shape you clicked on into a circle:

Second, clicking on any shape turns the shape you clicked on into a square:

Third, clicking on any shape turns the shape you clicked on into an upside down triangle

Fourth, clicking on any shape turns the shape you clicked on into an octagon

Fifth, clicking on any shape turns the shape you clicked on into a heart

The next click should then start the process from beginning, turning the shape you clicked on into a triangle

Then the next click will be a circle again, then a square, etc. The process can repeat indefinitely.

Use `$(event.currentTarget)` to target the clicked shape. Use the provided classes to give the shapes ... shape.

## Hungry for More?

- Dynamically generate the initial triangles using jQuery, and set the event listener (once) in the loop
- Set a ‘mouseenter’ event on the shapes that changes the color of the shape to black
- Set a ‘mouseleave’ event on the shapes that changes the color of the shape back to red
